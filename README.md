PROJECT TITLE- SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY

Problem statement- 
  The project aims to develop a Python-based application that securely hides text messages within images using steganography.  
  Users will be able to upload an image, input a text message, and provide a key to encrypt and embed the message within the image. 
  This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the hidden data, making it accessible only to authorized users.

Technology's Used-
  -OpenCV (cv2): Utilized for its robust image processing capabilities, OpenCV allows for the manipulation and embedding of data within images efficiently. It handles complex image transformations, making it essential for implementing steganography.
    install cv2 from - pip install opencv-python
  -os Module: This module provides a way to interact with the operating system, allowing for seamless file handling operations. It is used to manage input/output operations, navigate directories, and handle file paths crucial for accessing and saving images.
  -string Module: The string module offers a collection of useful string operations. It is used for text manipulation, ensuring that the input text message is properly formatted and processed before being embedded within the image.
